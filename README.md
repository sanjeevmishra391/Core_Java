1. Compilation: Parsing, Process Annotations, Flow, Generats Bytecode (.class file)
2. Execution: ClassLoader(The main class is loaded into the memory bypassing its ‘.class’ file to the JVM), Bytecode Verifier(job is to check that the instructions don’t perform damaging actions), Just-In-Time Compiler(job is to convert the loaded bytecode into machine code)
